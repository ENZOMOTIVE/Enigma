## Problem Statement

In many industries (e.g., legal, finance, intellectual property), proving the existence of a document or piece of data at a specific time is crucial. Centralized timestamping services exist, but they are prone to single points of failure and manipulation. A decentralized solution can provide trustless, tamper-proof timestamping.

## Our Solution:
## Decentralized Proof-of-Existence (PoE) Service
Here's how it works:

Users submit a hash of their document/data to the contract.

Operators (staked nodes) validate and timestamp the submission.

Proofs are stored on-chain, and users can verify the existence of their data at a specific block.

## Key Features

Document Hashing: Users submit a hash of their document (e.g., SHA-256) to prove its existence.

Staked Operators: Only staked operators (via EigenLayer) can validate and timestamp submissions.

Immutable Proofs: Once a document is timestamped, the proof is stored on-chain and cannot be altered.

Verification: Anyone can verify the existence of a document by checking the on-chain proof.

## Use Cases

✅ Proving Digital Document Existence
A user submits the hash of a document (e.g., legal contract, academic paper, intellectual property, etc.) to the blockchain. This acts as proof of its existence at that time.

✅ Tamper-proof Record Verification
Operators validate submitted documents using cryptographic signatures, ensuring no tampering has occurred.

✅ Decentralized & Trustless System
Since everything is stored on-chain, the document's existence and timestamp cannot be altered or forged.
